Casper Hackathon 2026
Activity Introduction
Casper Hackathon 2026 invites developers worldwide to build the next generation of decentralized applications on Casper - an enterprise-grade, proof-of-stake blockchain designed for real-world scalability and performance.

Whether you're exploring DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, liquid staking solutions, or cross-chain interoperability, this is your opportunity to innovate on a platform that combines developer-friendly tooling with institutional-grade infrastructure.

Total Prize Pool: $40,000 USD
Cash Prizes ($25,000 Total)

Main Track: 1st Place: $10,000 | 2nd Place: $7,000 | 3rd Place: $3,000
Best Interoperability App: $2,500
Best Liquid Staking dApp: $2,500
NodeOps Platform Credits ($5,000 Total) Top 5 awards:

1st Prize: $1,800 credits
2nd Prize: $1,125 credits
3rd Prize: $720 credits

Why Build on Casper?
Casper offers a robust development environment with Rust-based smart contracts, WebAssembly execution, and seamless wallet integration via CSPR.click. The Odra framework accelerates development, while native Casper SDKs provide maximum flexibility for builders on most common platforms.

What You'll Gain:
$40,000 in prizes ($25,000 cash and $15,000 in API grants and credits) across multiple tracks, including special awards for interoperability and liquid staking projects
Technical and marketing support from the Casper Association for all winners
Post-hackathon grants and incubation opportunities for promising projects
Community voting via CSPR.fans, giving your project and your team visibility and online/social engagement
Access to mentorship, live workshops, training sessions, and office hours with core Casper developers and ecosystem experts during weekdays
Join us in building the future of Web3. Code, compete, and contribute to the Casper ecosystem.

Tracks
To align with the prize structure and key focus areas, the following tracks are established:
1. Main Track
For general submissions competing for the top 3 prizes. Open to all types of projects including DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, gaming, enterprise solutions, and developer tools.

2. Interoperability Track
For projects focused on cross-chain solutions, connecting Casper with other ecosystems. Build bridges, cross-chain messaging protocols, or multi-chain applications.

3. Liquid Staking Track
For dApps centered on liquid staking protocols, liquid staking tokens, or incorporating Casper's native liquid staking capabilities into their application.

Submission Requirements
Each submission should include the following:

Project Overview (required): 1–2 paragraphs explaining your project’s concept, purpose, and key features.
Demo Video (optional): A short video demonstrating your project’s functionality, if available.
GitHub Repository (optional): A link to your project’s source code, if the project is open source.
Functional Prototype (optional): A working prototype showcasing core on-chain functionality on the Casper Testnet.
Multiple Track Submissions: Projects may be submitted to multiple tracks if they meet the eligibility criteria for each.

No Previous Experience Needed: No prior experience with the Casper Network is required; our support team will guide you through the process.

On-chain Component Required: All projects must include an on-chain component to be eligible for rewards.

Fast-Track for Functional Prototypes: Projects with a fully functional prototype deployed on the Casper Testnet will automatically advance to the Final Round.

Community Choice Fast-Track: The top 5 projects selected through community voting will also advance to the Final Round, even if they do not meet all technical expectations such as having a functional prototype, Testnet deployment, or GitHub repository.

Event Phases and Voting
The hackathon will be conducted in two distinct phases:

1. Qualification Round
Open to all participants. Teams are encouraged to submit a functional prototype demonstrating core on-chain functionality on the Casper Testnet. At the end of this phase:

All projects with a functional prototype deployed on the Casper Testnet will automatically advance to the Final Round.
Top 5 projects determined through on-chain community voting will also advance to the Final Round, regardless of whether they have a functional prototype or Testnet deployment.
The Casper Association may, at its discretion, advance additional projects that demonstrate strong potential or significant value to the Casper ecosystem.
Evaluation will emphasize innovation, usability, and contribution to the Casper ecosystem.

Community voting will take place through the CSPR.fans app, where users can express their support and engagement for participating projects. The CSPR.fans platform will also serve to amplify visibility for projects and their teams.

2. Final Round
Finalists will further refine and enhance their projects based on feedback and technical improvements. They will compete in the Final Round, where winners will be chosen through an on-chain community vote conducted via the Casper community app (CSPR.fans). This ensures transparent and decentralized decision-making by the Casper community.

Projects must have fully functional prototypes, generating on-chain activity for the Final Round to be eligible for any prizes.

Voting and Winner Selection
Both rounds will leverage Casper's native governance tools to carry out verifiable, on-chain voting. This approach promotes fairness, transparency, and full traceability of results while empowering the Casper community to play a decisive role in recognizing innovation and excellence.

Apart from the winners chosen by the community, the Casper Association may choose to support projects which are going to fill a fundamental gap in the ecosystem or uncover an appealing opportunity.

Anti-Fraud: Measures will be in place to ensure fair voting and submission authenticity. Winners will need to pass KYC/AML to be eligible to receive the rewards.
